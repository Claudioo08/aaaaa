        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Justine Bryan R. Padua, I am an 18 years old student who studies in the University of the East Caloocan. I live far away from my school and I have to commute for around 1-2 hours everyday depending on the traffic. I live in North Caloocan in a Subdivision. I am an only child so it's easier for me to do the things that I like. My mom is raising me by myself because I don't have any clues about my dad and I never bothered asking. I used to be competing in the Arnis competitions back in junior high so I have experience on self defence (with arnis). </p>
